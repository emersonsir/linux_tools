      Add the memtrack utility.

      This utility attempts to track the PSS usage of all of the
      processes in the system. It will keep track of the min/max/avg/last
      PSS for every process it has ever seen and dump that information when
      the program is terminated or when a USR1 or TSTP signal is sent to
      the process.
