Some convenient tools for daily work

## jgrep (obsolete, Now I use "ag" instead)
jgrep is a 'grep' like program with java regex flavor, targeted for advanced daily regex use

### aziokbd
modified driver for Fujitsu KH800 keyboard. Original author posted it on [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/Swoogan/aziokbd).
I also wrote a [guide](http://cfig.github.io/2015/09/22/linux-keyboard-driver/) in my blog describing how it's modified.

## db\_tool
db\_tool is a wrapper tool to operate on [cscope](http://cscope.sourceforge.net) and [ctags](http://ctags.sourceforge.net/). It can manage projects and build indexes(cscope.out and tags). Then index files can be auto-loaded in vim.
